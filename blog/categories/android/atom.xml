    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>Android Wear Core Experience</h1>

<p>The Android Wear UI consists of two main spaces centered around the core functions of <strong>Suggest</strong> and <strong>Demand</strong></p>

<h2>The Context Stream (Suggest)</h2>

<p>This is effectively Google Now for Android Wear whereby users can swipe through a list of contextually relevant cards. Cards in the stream are more than simple notifications they can be swiped horizontally swiping may reveal buttons which allow actions</p>

<h2>The Cue Card (Demand)</h2>

<p>The cue card allows users to speak to Google. Swiping up on the cue card shows a list of suggested voice commands which can also be tapped.</p>

<p>Each suggested voice command activates a specific type of intent. Multiple applications may register for a single voice intent and the user will have the opportunity to choose which application they prefer (yuk .. seems like an area for some contextual help)</p>

<p>Applications can respond to a voice command in the same way as they respond to a tap on a regular in-stream action button. by adding or updating a stream card or by launching a full screen application.</p>
