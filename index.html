  <div class="entry-content"><p>In 2012 I spent just over a year learning, practicing and teaching eXtreme Programming (XP). One of the main components of XP, is the practice of pair programming. When I changed jobs in mid 2013 I have to say when asked that I was quite ambivalent about the power of pair programming. I could accept the two heads are better than one assertion, instant code review, really small feedback cycles as good things but stacked against TDD which I had swallowed hook line and sinker pairing was a bit of Meh! its ok but depends on the context.</p>

<p>My new job had no real development methodology to speak of and a very small dev team. In this environment I reverted back to my hunker down, put on the headphones and turn up the music too loud approach mode of coding. Recently I have taken on the refactoring of a largish platform (with no tests of course) and three weeks into this effort I beginning to get a fresh appreciation of pairing and that is that it breaks the monotony we all run into when on a large projects. Days of coding stories, refactoring, testing takes its strain and productivity wanes as your mind tries to break away and follow something more interesting. I realized when I was pairing this never happened even when engaged in the depths of dev-ops tasks. There was constant interaction with another human, sharing of ideas, arguing process and design issues and there was also the time to just sit back and watch someone else take the keyboard for a while, observing their flow, their style and more often than not learning.</p>

<p><img src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/pair-programming.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>So I now see the real value of pair programming, at least to me, its Social! and that is a good thing. Having that constant interaction and change which once seems so strange is actually good for me. It breaks me out of the self centered monotony of hacking away at a single blob of code making incremental progress. Such things become less monotonous and Im fairly sure progress would be more swift with another set of eyes there would be another person to field questions later. Suffice it to say I am missing those pairing days I found so strange and unnecessary.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Initial security warning.</h2>

<p>Never a good thing when the what you are investigating starts with a security warning, but that is what you get when starting out with <a href="http://inabox.funf.org/">Funf in a box</a></p>

<p><em>The current beta release of Funf In a Box has a security vulnerability that could allow a user of your app access to your other users&#8217; data. Exploiting this vulnerability requires having hold of your Android app package (.apk), programming skills, and is not trivial to implement. Nevertheless, until fixed, it is recommended that you do not use Funf In a Box for large scale studies where you do not control the devices or trust the participants, or release the app on the Android Market. This is not a cross app issue.</em></p>

<p>So you have been warned.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1>Design Principles</h1>

<p>These are the stated design principles for Android wear. I am included their suggested tips for app designers</p>

<h2>Focus on not stopping the user.</h2>

<p>The basic design is to enable an information snacking model rather than an in your face &ldquo;deal with this now&rdquo; type model. As such causing the user to stop whatever they are doing for longer than 5 secs is not seen as good design.</p>

<p><strong>Google Tip</strong>
Time a typical use of your Wear app. If using it takes more than 5 seconds, you should think about making your app more focused. Also try using your app while you’re having a conversation, and see how it affects your train of thought and eye contact.</p>

<h2>Design for big Gestures</h2>

<p>Basically be aware that fingers are big relative to the screen size, hence any gestures or interaction needs to large enough for humans to use them without a great deal of precision.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://developer.android.com/design/media/wear/biggesture.png"></p>

<p><strong>Google Tip</strong>
Use your app in various everyday situations, such as walking, eating, talking to people, or ordering coffee. If you have to slow down while walking or stop the conversation to be precise, you should consider how your gestures could be bigger.</p>

<h2>Think about stream cards first</h2>

<p>This is probably the most important aspect of app design for the watch. Try and make your stream cards, contextual and contextually consistent. When to show your card in the stream is probably the most important design decision you will make. Otherwise your app should be on demand only.</p>

<p><strong>Google Tip</strong>
Make a list of all the situations a user would find your app useful. What do they have in common? Same location? Time of day? Certain physical activities? You will most likely come up with several different situations &ndash; that’s a good sign, because it means that you can specialize your cards to those situations. Remember that the user always has the option of completely muting your stream cards if they feel they aren’t relevant enough.</p>

<h2>Do One thing, really fast</h2>

<p>Make your point, user engagement is typically swift in duration. Put the most important information first and then let the user browse deeper if and when they want to.</p>

<p><strong>Google Tip</strong>
How many bits of information is there in your design? Is everything absolutely necessary, or could you split it up into separate cards? If you’re designing a card, don’t forget that you can use multiple pages.</p>

<h2>Design for the corner of the eye</h2>

<p>Similar to the last one, basically try not to distract the user, simply inform them design for glanceability.</p>

<p><strong>Google Tip</strong>
To view your app with your peripheral vision, try focusing on your knuckles while your watch is displaying the app. Do you get a sense of what it is trying to do? Is it distinguishable from other apps? Does the background image help conveying the message? Does it use photos or a distinct shape and color?</p>

<h2>Don&rsquo;t be a consistent shoulder tapper</h2>

<p>You can vibrate the device for attention but doing it all the time is not good. Interesting to note that this is the opposite to the Samsung design where al events are displayed and the user is buzzed. Make use of vibration to get attention only for really important information.</p>

<p><strong>Google Tip</strong>
Next time you’re in a conversation, imagine someone tapping you your shoulder, interrupting you with the information you want your app to deliver. If the information delivered did not justify suspending a conversation, you should not make the notification interruptive.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1>Android Wear Core Experience</h1>

<p>The Android Wear UI consists of two main spaces centered around the core functions of <strong>Suggest</strong> and <strong>Demand</strong></p>

<h2>The Context Stream (Suggest)</h2>

<p>This is effectively Google Now for Android Wear whereby users can swipe through a list of contextually relevant cards. Cards in the stream are more than simple notifications they can be swiped horizontally swiping may reveal buttons which allow actions</p>

<p><img src="http://developer.android.com/wear/images/screens/stream.gif"></p>

<h2>The Cue Card (Demand)</h2>

<p>The cue card allows users to speak to Google. Swiping up on the cue card shows a list of suggested voice commands which can also be tapped.</p>

<p>Each suggested voice command activates a specific type of intent. Multiple applications may register for a single voice intent and the user will have the opportunity to choose which application they prefer (yuk .. seems like an area for some contextual help)</p>

<p>Applications can respond to a voice command in the same way as they respond to a tap on a regular in-stream action button. by adding or updating a stream card or by launching a full screen application.</p>

<p><img src="http://developer.android.com/wear/images/screens/cuecard.gif"></p>

<h2>Other Features</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Home Screen</strong> is the default state and has a background, status indicators and the top ranked context card can be seen poking up from the bottom of the screen</li>
<li><strong>Ambient Mode</strong> some devices may put the device into ambient mode, users can exist ambient mode by tapping on the screen.</li>
<li><strong>Settings Screen</strong> is a cue card and fairly self describing</li>
<li><strong>Full Screen Apps</strong> can be launched on top of the man screen where a wider range of interaction is called for.</li>
</ul>

<p>There will be more later</p>
