    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Well lets try this again. I remember starting an octopress blog well over a year ago. A lot has changed since then. Back then I was at working for <a href="http://www.snapfish.com">Snapfish</a> building out a new IOS application and service, seconded to <a href="http://pivotallabs.com">Pivotal Labs</a> to learn XP and basis for running good agile products. Now I work for <a href="http://www.sisa.samsung.com">Samsung Research America</a>, working mostly in Android and Rails with a smattering of other stuff.</p>

<p>Quite a journey but perhaps one where I have learned as much as I possibly could about state of the art software systems development and deployment.</p>

<p>WIth this blog (which I will try to keep updated) I will hopefully discuss some useful and interesting things related to my craft</p>
